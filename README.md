# Description

This Phase 2 Project is part of the Moringa School Software Engineering Program where we will be creating a Budget Planner.  We will be using netlify.app to deploy the application.

The library weâ€™ll be using is React JS where we will utilize the different functionalities such as useEffect, useRef, and useState among others.

# Project Guidelines

- You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
- Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
- There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. - Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. 

# Project Setup
- Run npm install
- Run npm start. This will start your server on a port e.g http://localhost:3000

# Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:
- Add an expenses
- Delete an expense
- Edit the budget
